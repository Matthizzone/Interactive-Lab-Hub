## Part A. Plan 

_Setting:_ Anywhere food and drink is allowed, for example a cafeteria, outside, at home, etc.

_Players:_ Person using the device only. The light on the device has the potential to get the attention of/distract anyone else in the nearby area.

_Activity:_ The user is using the device like a thermometer or geiger counter.

_Goals:_ To determine if a carbonated drink can has been shaken or not, and from this, wether or not it is safe to open.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Most people thought the device would be useful; however, they feared that many users would not remember to carry their Shake Meter with them, and they would frequently find themselves not having it on their person when they want to drink a carbonated beverage. It was suggested that a Shake Meter could come with every pack of 6 coke cans (or whoever the participating companies are), or it could be a feature of refrigerators or a smartphone app.


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

The storyboard accurately depicted the device interaction.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

The acting we performed was very exaggerated and cartoonish. In reality, this device would not involve so much theatrics and would be used in a similar fashion to a thermometer or pH meter: briefly, discretely, and without much thought.


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

Was unable to use Tinkerbelle because I was having trouble running Python and connecting to the server from a Chromebook (Chrome OS).


## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

The device features a curved surface to indicate where the can should be placed, and a skinny, ergonomically designed handle for where the user's hand should grab it. The choice of shapes depicted above help the user to understand the device on their first iteraction with it, without having to read a single word.


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

My partners liked the idea, but would have liked to see more development, such as use of more colors.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
