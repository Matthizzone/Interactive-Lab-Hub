# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.


## Part A. Plan 

_Setting:_ Anywhere food and drink is allowed, for example a cafeteria, outside, at home, etc.

_Players:_ Person using the device only. The light on the device has the potential to get the attention of/distract anyone else in the nearby area.

_Activity:_ The user is using the device like a thermometer or geiger counter.

_Goals:_ To determine if a carbonated drink can has been shaken or not, and from this, wether or not it is safe to open.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Most people thought the device would be useful; however, they feared that many users would not remember to carry their Shake Meter with them, and they would frequently find themselves not having it on their person when they want to drink a carbonated beverage. It was suggested that a Shake Meter could come with every pack of 6 coke cans (or whoever the participating companies are), or it could be a feature of refrigerators or a smartphone app.


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

The storyboard accurately depicted the device interaction.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

The device could have a brigher light for a more shaken soda, and a dimmer light for a less shaken soda. In other words, the more dangerous the shaken can is, the brighter the light (or different color).




FIX THIS NOW NOW NOW NO





## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

Was unable to use Tinkerbelle because I was having trouble running Python and connecting to the server from a Chromebook (Chrome OS).


## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Was unable to use Tinkerbelle because I was having trouble running Python and connecting to the server from a Chromebook (Chrome OS).

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

The device features a curved surface to indicate where the can should be placed, and a skinny, ergonomically designed handle for where the user's hand should grab it. The choice of shapes depicted above help the user to understand the device on their first iteraction with it, without having to read a single word.


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
