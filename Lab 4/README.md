# Ph-UI!!!

For lab this week, we focus on both on sensing, to bring in new modes of input into your devices, as well as prototyping the physical look and feel of the device. You will think about the physical form the device needs to perform the sensing as well as present the display or feedback about what was sensed. 

## Part 1 Lab Preparation

### Get the latest content:
As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. As we discussed in the class, there are 2 ways you can do so:

**\[recommended\]**Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the personal access token for this.

```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2021
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab4 content"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

### Start brasinstorming ideas by reading:

## The Report (Part 1: A-D, Part 2: E-F)

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction 

We want to introduce you to the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in your kit. It's one of the most flexible input devices we are able to provide. At boot, it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes, it considers it a user touch. You can attach any conductive material. In your kit, you have copper tape that will work well, but don't limit yourself! In the example below, we use Twizzlers--you should pick your own objects.


<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/cropped_images/000/003/226/medium640/MPR121_top_angle.jpg?1609282424" height="150" />
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/1200x900/4401-01.jpg" height="150">
</p>


Plug in the capacitive sensor board with the QWIIC connector. Connect your Twizzlers with either the copper tape or the alligator clips (the clips work better). In this lab, we will continue to use the `circuitpython` virtual environment we created before. Activate `circuitpython` and `cd` to your Lab 4 folder to install the requirements by:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/679721816318803975/823299613812719666/PXL_20210321_205742253.jpg" width=400>
These Twizzlers are connected to pads 6 and 10. When you run the code and touch a Twizzler, the terminal will print out the following

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python cap_test.py 
Twizzler 10 touched!
Twizzler 6 touched!
```

### Part B
### More sensors

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

We here want you to get to know this awesome sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595). It is capable of sensing proximity, light (also RGB), and gesture! 

<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-03.jpg" width=200>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the 3 example scripts individually to see what the sensor is capable of doing!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python light_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python proximity_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python gesture_test.py
...
```

You can go the the [Adafruit GitHub Page](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_APDS9960) to see more examples for this sensor!

#### Rotary Encoder

A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position to analog or digital output signals. The [Adafruit rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991#technical-details) we ordered for you came with separated breakout board and encoder itself, that is, they will need to be soldered if you have not yet done so! We will be bringing the soldering station to the lab class for you to use, also, you can go to the MakerLAB to do the soldering off-class. Here is some [guidance on soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/preparation) from Adafruit. When you first solder, get someone who has done it before (ideally in the MakerLAB environment). It is a good idea to review this material beforehand so you know what to look at.

```

You can go to the [Adafruit Learn Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-qt-rotary-encoder/python-circuitpython) to learn more about the sensor! The sensor actually comes with an LED (neo pixel): Can you try lighting it up? 

#### Joystick

A [joystick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15168) can be used to sense and report the input of the stick for it pivoting angle or direction. It also comes with a button input!

#### (Optional) Distance Sensor

Note: We did not distribute this sensor to you, so if you are interested in playing with it, please come pick it up from the TA!

Earlier we have asked you to play with the proximity sensor, which is able to sense object within a short distance. Here, we offer [Qwiic Multi Distance Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17072), which has a field of view of about 25Â° and is able to detect objects up to 3 meters away!

```

You can go to the [SparkFun GitHub Page](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_VL53L1X_Py) to learn more about the sensor and see other examples!

### Part C
### Physical considerations for sensing

Usually, sensors need to positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for their application. Now that you've tried a bunch of the sensors, pick one that you would like to use, and an application where you use the output of that sensor for an interaction. For example, you can use a distance sensor to measure someone's height if you position it overhead and get them to stand under it.

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches of different ways you might use your sensor, and how the larger device needs to be shaped in order to make the sensor useful.\*\*\***

\[Included in the images above (handwritten)\]

**\*\*\*Pick one of these designs to prototype.\*\*\***

I will design the Joystick Keyboard because I think it will be the most novel and unique device interaction experience for new users.


### Part D
### Physical considerations for displaying information and housing parts


Here is an Pi with a paper faceplate on it to turn it into a display interface:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/paper_if.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>


This is fine, but the mounting of the display constrains the display location and orientation a lot. Also, it really only works for applications where people can come and stand over the Pi, or where you can mount the Pi to the wall.

Here is another prototype for a paper display:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/b_box.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Your kit includes these [SparkFun Qwiic OLED screens](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153). These use less power than the MiniTFTs you have mounted on the GPIO pins of the Pi, but, more importantly, they can be more flexibily be mounted elsewhere on your physical interface. The way you program this display is almost identical to the way you program a  Pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/6/1/3/5/17153-SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Display__0.91_in__128x32_-01.jpg" height="200" />
<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/679466987314741338/823354087105101854/PXL_20210322_003033073.jpg" height="200">
</p>


It holds a Pi and usb power supply, and provides a front stage on which to put writing, graphics, LEDs, buttons or displays.

This design can be made by scoring a long strip of corrugated cardboard of width X, with the following measurements:

| Y height of box <br> <sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Z  depth of box <br><sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Y height of box  | Z  depth of box | H height of faceplate <br><sub><sup>* * * * * (don't make this too short) * * * * *</sup></sub>|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 

Fold the first flap of the strip so that it sits flush against the back of the face plate, and tape, velcro or hot glue it in place. This will make a H x X interface, with a box of Z x X footprint (which you can adapt to the things you want to put in the box) and a height Y in the back. 

Here is an example:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/horoscope.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Think about how you want to present the information about what your sensor is sensing! Design a paper display for your project that communicates the state of the Pi and a sensor. Ideally you should design it so that you can slide the Pi out to work on the circuit or programming, and then slide it back in and reattach a few wires to be back in operation.
 
**\*\*\*Sketch 5 designs for how you would physically position your display and any buttons or knobs needed to interact with it.\*\*\***

<img src="https://github.com/Matthizzone/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%204/images/joystick_keyboard_sketches.jpg" width="800" />

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

\[included in the sketches above (handwritten)\]

**\*\*\*Pick one of these display designs to integrate into your prototype.\*\*\***

I have chosen to implement the design titled "ergonomic". See explanation below.

**\*\*\*Explain the rationale for the design.\*\*\*** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)

Ideally, Joystick Keyboard would be a device small enough to be comfortably held in one hand, and there would be no wires or other components attached to it. However, there are issues associated with putting the whole Pi in a single hand.

First, there is an issue of size. The Raspberry Pi circiut board is quite large already, and after being wrapped in a box along with the joystick circuit board, it would definitely be too large to be held all at once (see the design above "clunky"). This inspired the idea for the design "wrist," in which only the joystick is in the hand of the user, but the Pi is attached to some kind of arm band, kind of like a arm-bound phone case for runners. While this does solve the problem of reducing the volume in the user's grip, it seemed uncomfortable to wear and put on/take off: not to mention a safety hazard since the processors on the Raspberry Pi can heat up to burn temperature. 

Second, not matter the design, there will always be a wire running from the users hand. If we assume the user holds just the joystick, the pesky wire will be that connecting the joystick to the Pi. If we assume the user holds both the Pi and the joystick, the pesky wire will be that connecting the Pi to the wall outlet.

Even though the goal was to have a small, one-handed, wireless device, and there was no way to achieve all of these things at once given our current hardware, I have settled with the best alternative: the design "ergonomic". Only the joystick will be contained in a box, and wire will run out the bottom of the device to connect to the Raspberry Pi, which will be rested on a table or in the other hand of the user. The piece in the user's grip should be small, and the only downside is a thin wire running out the device in a place that does not interfere with interaction. (A wire running out of the top of the device might get caught in the user's fingers or in the joystick itself.




Build a cardbord prototype of your design.

<img src="https://github.com/Matthizzone/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%204/images/prototype.png" width="800" />

**\*\*\*Document your rough prototype.\*\*\***

So, as described above the cardboard mock-up of this device features only the joystick sticking out of the top of a small box that is (hopefully) ergonomically designed (this will be tested when other users test the device, I will ask how it feels to hold). The wire runs out the bottom of the device and connects to the Pi

First I selected a firm cardboard and acquired masking tape and scissors. I chose this particular firm cardboard because I did want the device to crumple under human grip strength. I then began construction.

I started with the circular opening out which the joystick protrudes. At first the hole was not circular and instead had many straight edges and corners (like a hexagon). This made rolling the joystick in a circle awkward and not smoothe. I solved this issue by running tape over the corners, and then using the joystick to tuck it in, rounding out the vertexes. After enough iterations, the hole was close to circular. Next I constructed a casing around the bottom of the joystick. This involved many layers of carboard stacked on top of each other. I did not want the device to crumple under the force of human grip strength. Then I used large flat pieces of carboard to conceal the inner workings and complete the build.

At first I set out to match the contour of human hands by only cutting and taping together rectangular cardboard, but his proved to be difficult. I was able to produce a shape that, while not the most aesthetically pleasing, it wasn't burdensome to use and didn't jut out with harsh corners or sharp angles. I was suprised at how well the joystick responds to user input. I had worried that the cardboard container would interfere with it's working but this turned out not to be an issue.







LAB PART 2

### Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.

### Part E (Optional)
### Servo Control with Joystick

In the class kit, you should be able to find the [Qwiic Servo Controller](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16773) and [Micro Servo Motor SG51](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2201). The Qwiic Servo Controller will need external power supply to drive, which we will be distributing the battery packs in the class. Connect the servo controller to the miniPiTFT through qwiic connector and connect the external battery to the 2-Pin JST port (ower port) on the servo controller. Connect your servo to channel 2 on the controller, make sure the brown is connected to GND and orange is connected to PWM.

<img src="https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/245605956_303690921194525_3309212261588023460_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=ae9488&_nc_ohc=FvFLlClTKuUAX9nJ3LR&_nc_ht=scontent-lga3-1.xx&oh=b7ec1abc8d458b6c1b7a00a6f11398ac&oe=618D7D96" width="400"/>

In this exercise, we will be using the nice [ServoKit library](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver/python-circuitpython) developed by Adafruit! We will continue to use the `circuitpython` virtual environment we created. Activate the virtual environment and make sure to install the latest required libraries by running:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

A servo motor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position. The position of a servo motor is set by the width of an electrical pulse, that is, we can use PWM (pulse-width modulation) to set and control the servo motor position. You can read [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-14-servo-motors/servo-motors) to learn a bit more about how exactly a servo motor works.

Now that you have a basic idea of what a servo motor is, look into the script `qwiic_servo_example.py` we provide. In line 14, you should see that we have set up the min_pulse and max_pulse corresponding to the servo turning 0 - 180 degree. Try running the servo example code now and see what happens:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python servo_test.py
```

It is also possible to control the servo using the sensors mentioned in as in part A and part B, and/or from some of the buttons or parts included in your kit, the simplest way might be to chain Qwiic buttons to the other end of the Qwiic OLED. Like this:

<p align="center"> <img src="chaining.png"  width="200" ></p>

You can then call whichever control you like rather than setting a fixed value for the servo. For more information on controlling Qwiic devices, Sparkfun has several python examples, such as [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-joystick-hookup-guide/all#python-examples).

We encourage you to try using these controls, **while** paying particular attention to how the interaction changes depending on the position of the controls. For example, if you have your servo rotating a screen (or a piece of cardboard) from one position to another, what changes about the interaction if the control is on the same side of the screen, or the opposite side of the screen? Trying and retrying different configurations generally helps reveal what a design choice changes about the interaction -- _make sure to document what you tried_!

### Part F
### Record

Document all the prototypes and iterations you have designed and worked on! Again, deliverables for this lab are writings, sketches, photos, and videos that show what your prototype:

### Prototype 2
<img src="https://github.com/Matthizzone/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%204/IMG_0895.JPG" width="800" />
During one interaction, the user held the controller sideways. I realized that without any prior knowledge about the device, there is no clear "correct" orientation. In this protoype, I added text to the top face of the device. That way, even if the user has never seen this device before, they have seen English text which they know how to orient correctly, leading to correct orientation of the device. We see a user holding the device as intended in the second interaction, video taped and available at the link below:

Video of the interaction here: https://youtu.be/JVlxOv4SYUg

* "Looks like": I drew inspiration for the appearance of this device from a Nintendo Nunchuck (below). The difference is that the Nunchuck is ergonomically designed while the Joystick Keyboard is a harsh rectangle.
* "Works like": Should look and be like a keyboard: If used properly, the input of English letters one at a time is the exact same function as a keyboard.
* "Acts like": The interesting twist on this device is that even though it "works like" a keyboard, it really should behave like a TV remote: a one-handed control-at-a-distance point-and-shoot like device.

<img src="https://github.com/Matthizzone/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%204/ideal.png" width="200" />

The biggest challenge I faced in designing this interaction was communicating how to use the device. How to hold it and put your thumb in the right spot was implied by the 3D interposition of parts and shapes, but the mechanics of how to input letters (only lowercase), was a bit confusing at first. Users were frustrated with the lack of accuracy, but after I informed to look past that and instead focus on the mechanics of the interaction instead of the performance, they were pleased with the interesting twist on typing that this device creates, "shaped" by it's 3D shape.
